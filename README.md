# Investment-Tracker
This is a web development project by the name of "INVESTARO".
It is a simple record based system where you can enter the details of your investments in order to keep a track record of them.
Apart from this, there are two additonal features:
1. The Expense Calculator: It is a simple calculator that takes a few expense details as an input and produces a detailed report about your expenses in  a graphical manner.
2. The Home Affordability Calculator: It is a simple tool which helps you to find the budget for a affordable home by inputting just a few simple details.

All the tools are based on the rules of investments and housing like the 20-30-50 rule and 28/36 rule.
